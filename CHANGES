HdfsCLI
=======

Version 2.0 (?)
---------------

* Add python 3 support (the Kerberos extension's requirements must however
  be manually installed).
* Allow specifying relative client roots. These will be assumed relative to the
  user's home directory.
* Add several client methods: `makedirs`, `set_times`, `checksum`,
  `set_replication`.
* Add `progress` argument to `Client.read` and `Client.upload` and a
 `chunk_size` argument to the latter to allow better tracking.
* `Client.read` and `Client.write` can now return file-like objects (supporting
  `read` and `write` calls respectively).
* Improve robustness of `KerberosClient`. In particular add the
  `max_concurrency` parameter which can be tuned to prevent authentication
  errors when too many simultaneous requests are being made. Along with
  the new delay parameter, this lets us remove the timeouts in
  `Client.download` and `Client.upload`, which both simplify and speed up these
  functions.
* Change alias suffix in `~/.hdfsrc` (from `_alias` to `.alias`). The old one
  is still supported.
* Add `autoload.modules` and `autoload.paths` configuration keys.
* Add `--verbose` option to CLI, enabling logging at various levels.
* Add `strict` option to `Client.status` and `Client.content`.

Breaking changes:

* Add `session` argument to `Client` and remove newly redundant parameters.
* Make `alias` argument mandatory for `Client.from_alias`. Default alias
  resolution logic is moved to the CLIs.
* Change default entry point name to `hdfscli` to avoid clashing with
  Hadoop HDFS script.
* `Client.delete` returns a boolean indicating success (rather than failing if
  the path was already empty).
* `Client.read` must now be used in a `with` block. This ensures that
  connections are properly closed. The context manager now returns a file like
  object (useful for composing with other functions, e.g. to decode Avro).
  Setting `chunk_size` to a positive value will make it return a generator
  similar to the previous behavior.
* Rename `Client.set_permissions` to `Client.set_permission` to make
  `permission` argument uniform across `Client` methods (alway singular,
  consistent with WebHDFS API).
* `Client.parts` will now throw an error if called on a normal file.
* Make most client attributes private (e.g. `cert`, `timeout`, etc.), except
  `url` and `root`.
* Remove `--` prefix from CLI commands. Also simplify CLI to only
  interactive, download and upload commands (write and read behavior can
  be achieved by passing '-' as local path). The `Client` API changes
  should make it more convenient to perform these from a python shell.
* Change meaning of `n_threads` option in `Client.download` and
  `Client.upload`.
* Change `Client.walk` to be consistent with `os.walk`. Also change meaning of
  `depth` option.
* Add `status` option to `Client.list`, `Client.walk`, and `Client.parts`. By
  default these functions now only return the names of the relevant files and
  folders.
* Remove `Client.append` method.
* Don't import symbols exported by extensions.


Version 1.4.0 (2015/07/24)

* Deprecate `Client.append` (in favor of `append` argument to
  `Client.write`).
