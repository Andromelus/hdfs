HdfsCLI
=======

Version 2.0 (?)
---------------

* Add python 3 support (except Kerberos extension).
* Add `Client.makedirs` method.
* Allow use of `Client.read` as context manager.
* Add progress hook to `Client.write`, `Client.read`, `Client.upload`, and
  `Client.download`.

Breaking changes:

* `Client.parts` will now throw an error if called on a normal file.
* Make most client attributes private (e.g. `url`, `timeout`, etc.), except
  `root`. This is to keep autocompletion suggestions cleaner.
* Remove `--` prefix from CLI commands. Also simplify CLI to only
  interactive, download and upload commands (write and read behavior can
  be achieved by passing '-' as local path). The `Client` API changes
  should make it more convenient to perform these from a python shell.
* Rename `Client.set_permissions` to `Client.set_permission` to make
  `permission` argument uniform across `Client` methods (alway singular,
  consistent with WebHDFS API).
* Change meaning of `n_threads` option in `Client.download` and
  `Client.upload`.
* Add `status` option to `Client.list`, `Client.walk`, and `Client.parts`. By
  default these functions now only return the names of the relevant files and
  folders.
* Change `Client.walk` to be consistent with `os.walk`. Also change meaning of
  `depth` option.
* Remove `Client.append` method.
* `Client.delete` returns boolean indicating success (rather than failing if
  the path was already empty).

Version 1.4.0 (2015/07/24)
